### Welcome!

Generating or optimizing molecules that satisfy desirable outcomes is an open challenge in many applications, such as drug design and material science. 
In fact, this process requires a significant investment of time and money with a high risk of failure. 
At ParacosmCraft, we develop advanced AI-based solutions that go deep into the understanding of how molecules are created, interact with a biochemical target, and how it behaves providing insights into what really happens and, more importantly, why it happens. 
A Paracosm, is a detailed imaginary world. The creator of a Paracosm has a complex and deeply felt relationship with this subjective universe, which may incorporate elements from the real or imaginary world. 
As our name suggests, we are crafting a Paracosm for the universe of molecules and atoms, unleashing the power of a blend between AI, quantum mechanics, chemistry, and biology.

### About me

I am a researcher specializing in the interdisciplinary field of Artificial Intelligence and Science, holding a master's degree in Data Science from Cairo University (2024).
My M.Sc. research was centered on integrating Graph Neural Networks and Deep Reinforcement Learning for the generation and optimization of molecules with desired chemical and geometrical properties in 3D space.
Fueled by a passion towards molecules, I didicated my life for diving deeper into this beautiful universe, leveraging the synergies of chemistry, biology, and quantum mechanics with AI and advanced computational tools to explore and exploit new frontiers in science.
